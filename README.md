### Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Competitions

Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Kaggle Competitions @ MSc. Computer Science & Engineering - Politecnico di Milano

## Image Classification 

Competition available on https://www.kaggle.com/c/ann-and-dl-image-classification

### Purpose

Given an image, the goal is to segment buildings at pixel level, thus predicting for each pixel if it belongs to a building (class 1) or not (class 0). 

## Image Segmentation 

Competition available on https://www.kaggle.com/c/ann-and-dl-image-segmentation

### Purpose

The main goal is to solve a classification problem on the proposed dataset, which contains images of several objects belonging to 20 different classes. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.
